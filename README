Tandem - version: 0.1.1
======

A simple Rails plugin that brings basic CMS functionality to any app.  Just drop it in and go.


Installation
=======

  script/plugin install git@github.com:12spokes/tandem.git

For now, you need to copy all of the migrations in /vendor/plugins/tandem/db/migrate up to the route of your rails app.

Add the following line to your app's routes.rb.  Most often, you'll want it at the bottom.

  map.connect ':token', :controller => 'tandem_pages', :action => 'show'

Define who can edit content in your application_controller.rb.  By default, anyone can add/edit/destroy pages and content.

  def can_edit_tandem_content?
    logged_in? && @current_user.admin?
  end


Usage
=======

Go to /tandem_pages to manage your pages.

Tandem supports finding pages by token, so if you give your page a token of jumping_jacks, the page can be found at /jumping_jacks.

There isn't a backend for managing content.  Well, there is, but it isn't the intended method for managing content and might go away.

You manage content by going to the page.  If you are able to edit it, you'll see Edit and Delete links as well as a link to add content.


Roadmap
=======
 * support custom page titles
 * custom view templates
 * meta keywords and descriptions
 * icons for edit and delete (and style them so they don't break the layout)
 * in-place editing
 * TandemImage library
 * make it easy to hook in custom TandemContent resource types.


Notes
=======
If you get a "A copy of AuthenticatedSystem has been removed from the module tree but is still active!" error
This is probably because you're using Restful_Authentication and there's some dependency problems.

Adding the following line to the app's environment.rb fixes it for now.

  config.load_once_paths += %W( #{RAILS_ROOT}/lib )

We hope to address this in the future.
