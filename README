Tandem
======

A simple Rails plugin that brings basic CMS functionality to any app.  Just drop it in and go.


Example

Notes
=======
If you get a "A copy of AuthenticatedSystem has been removed from the module tree but is still active!" error
This is probably because you're using Restful_Authentication and there's some dependency problems.

Adding the following line to the app's environment.rb fixes it for now.

config.load_once_paths += %W( #{RAILS_ROOT}/lib )

We hope to address this in the future.
